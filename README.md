This project demonstrates a basic AND logic gate simulation using Verilog HDL and the ModelSim simulator. It includes both the logic module and a complete testbench to verify all input combinations. The waveform view allows visual analysis of signal transitions in time, making it perfect for students or anyone learning digital logic design.
